  <div class="ppvAssignmentInstructionsLabel"><h2>Instructions</h2></div>
  <div class="ppvAssignmentInstructions">             <p><strong>Submission formats</strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>It is your responsibility to submit coursework in a format stipulated by your Module Leader.</strong> This will usually be a Microsoft Word file attachment with a .doc or .docx file extension. Apple Mac files such as .pages, will not be accepted for marking, unless specified by the Module Leader. Do not use the Submission Textbox unless your Module Leader tells you to do so. If in doubt, check with your Module Leader.</li>
			  <li>Your marks will be affected if the marking team cannot open or properly view your submission (for example, if you did not follow instructions on acceptable file formats).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Submitting multiple files</strong></p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Each upload attempt must contain the complete coursework submission. If you need to submit multiple files, make sure all files are attached to each submission you make.</strong></li>
	<li>The marking team will only have access to your most recent submission and the file(s) attached to this submission.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Submission deadlines</strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>The 48-hour late submission window is available (excluding Reasonable Adjustment submissions) in case you encounter any difficulties around the deadline of your assignment. It is available to all students, unless an assignment is exempt. Your programme or module team will not be able to provide you any additional assignment support during the 48-hour window, however you may be able to access support from other UWE services such as <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/it-services/it-service-desk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT Service Desk</a>, <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/study-support/student-support-advisers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Support Advisors</a> and the <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/life/health-and-wellbeing/get-wellbeing-support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wellbeing Service</a>. Please take note of core support hours.</li>
	<li><strong>You can submit as many times as you like up to end of the submission period; only the last successful submission will be marked.</strong></li>
	<li>Do not leave submission to the very last minute. Always allow time in case of technical issues.</li>
	<li>The date and time of your submission is taken from the Blackboard server and is recorded when your submission is complete, not when you click Submit.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Checking your submission</strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>It is essential that you check that you have submitted the correct file(s), and that each complete file was received. Submission receipts are accessed from the Coursework area.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Full guidance on submitting coursework is available on the <a target="_blank" href="http://info.uwe.ac.uk/online/blackboard/students/guides/assignments/view-submit.asp" rel="noopener">Blackboard support website</a>. All areas of your studies and assessments are governed by a set of rules known as the 'academic regulations'. A <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/academic-information/student-study-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student study essentials</a> guide is available to explain some of the key things you need to know about them.<br /><br /></p>

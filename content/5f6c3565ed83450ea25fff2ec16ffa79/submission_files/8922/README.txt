1.Selection controls
Many scenes in the game require selections, including main menu, pause scene, quit warning, ending scene, game configuration and maybe more in the future.
Use arrow keys to select your choices and use <Enter> to confirm them.

2.Game play
When the game start, a ball is spawned in the middle of the window.
It flashes for 3 seconds. After that, it starts to move in a random direction.
This is a 2 player game. Each player control 1 of the paddle at either left or right side of the window.
For the left paddle, use <W> and <S> to control it.
For the right paddle, use <Up> and <Down> to control it.
The aim of the game is to send the ball into the opposing player's goal (window's left / right boundary).
Hitting the ball by the front of the paddle can hit the ball back.
Hitting the ball by the side of the paddle can catch the ball.
Once the ball goes into the opposite goal or is caught by a paddle, that player gain the right to serve the ball, which is generally faster than a natural spawn ball.
If the ball was sent in the goal, the opposite player gain 1 point.
The player having more points at the end of the game wins.

3.Game configuration
Game modes and game time can be selected in the configuration scene, which will immediately shown after leaving the main menu.

There are 2 game modes, classic and endless.

When the time goes to 0, the game end automatically.

In endless mode, as the name is suggesting, its time is unlimited.
The game goes on until it is manually stopped.
There is a special rule that the ball is keep accelerating slightly so the difficulty is continueously increasing.

There are 5 selections: 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s, 120s.

If endless mode is selected, the game time selection box is closed.
